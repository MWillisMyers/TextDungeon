     the archer will be based on hit chance, so that when the player engages on an enemy farther away
     you have to spend points on your chance to hit that enemy. If the enemy is a Melee only, he will
     come closer to you over a few turns and try to hit you. If he does come close enough the ranger
     will have to resort to his knife. Enemys that have ranged/magic attacks will stay far and also have
     a hit chance. */
